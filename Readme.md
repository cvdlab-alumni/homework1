# Introduction

The Barcelona Pavilion, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, was the German Pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona, Spain. This building was used for the official opening of the German section of the exhibition.   
It is an important building in the history of modern architecture, known for its simple form and its spectacular use of extravagant materials, such as marble, red onyx and travertine. (from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Pavilion))    

Several documentation materials are stored in this [archive](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/homework1/blob/master/barcelona_pavilion.zip?raw=true).  
First spend some time to fully understand the simple structure of the building, using the given drawings and photographic documentation. Only later start the modeling work, item by item.   

The programming assignment must be produced in JavaScript language,  
using the `Plasm.js` development environment found at [http://cvd-lab.github.com/plasm.js/](http://cvd-lab.github.com/plasm.js/) location.  


# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Reproduce a 2D model of the floor plan of the Barcelona Pavilion  
using only the plasm.js primitives `POLYLINE` and `STRUCT`.

Let assume the grid of squares on the floor be `1.0m` x `1.0m`.

## Exercise 2

Reproduce a 3D model of the Barcellona Pavilion  
using only the plasm.js primitives `SIMPLEX_GRID` and `STRUCT`.

Affine transformations `T`,  `S` or  `R` are also allowed. 

## Exercise 3

Produce a colored version of the previous model.

## Exercise 4

Reproduce a 3D model of one piece of furniture, at your choice,  
and instance it one or more times inside the Pavillion.

# Assignment delivery

For each exercise you must produce a corresponding file `exercise1.js`, `exercise2.js`, etc.  
Such files must be contained in a directory entitled `2012-04-03`, pushed into your repository in cvdlab-cg organization:  
[https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/xxxxxx](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/) where `xxxxxx` is the student ID  (matricola). 

The delivery is strictly required within 24 hours from the publication of the homework.
